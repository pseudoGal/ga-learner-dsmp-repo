### Project Overview

 Problem Statement

You have been hired by the University of Data Science to manage their students' records. Your job is to create the student management system for the university. Let's try to build the system using basic Python operations.


### Learnings from the project

 Why solve this project?

After completing this project, you will get to know how to solve basic Python problems. In this project, you will be applying the following concepts:

    Mathematical operations
    List operations
    Dictionary operations
    String indexing and formatting.



### Approach taken to solve the problem

 Prepare the student roster

Let's create a new register by combining data from two classes while making some modifications to the register.


### Challenges faced

 Kudos to the Math genius!

For the student who has got the highest marks in this subject, the school has decided to award a Scholarship. Let's check who performed best in mathematics from all the students who appeared for the test. 


### Additional pointers

 Scholarship certificate

From the previous task, we know who is the 'Maths' topper in the class. You now have to print the name of the student on the certificate, but you will have to print his last name and then his first name.
